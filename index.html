    <p>In the ancient Sanskrit language of Hinduism and Buddhism, mandala means “circle.” Traditionally, a mandala is a
        geometric design or pattern that represents the cosmos or deities in various heavenly worlds.</p>

    <h2>what is it's purpose?</h2>
        <p>The brilliant psychoanalyst Carl Jung believed that the mandala represents the Self and that drawing a
            mandala gives a person a sacred space to meet that Self. He considered making mandalas an effective form of
            art therapy, helping to calm and comfort people struggling with mental health issues.</p>

    <h2>what is teaching mandala?
        <p>The teaching technique used is an experiential exercise that asks students to create group mandalas using art
            materials on circular pieces of butcher-block paper. The mandala concept is derived from the Buddhist
            tradition and means "circle" or "center" in Sanskrit.</p>

    <h2>what is healing mandala?
        <p>Beyond meditation, sand mandalas contain powerful healing energies. As the monks make the mandalas, they
            chant and meditate to evoke the positive vibrations residing within the sacred patterns. This energy has
            healing power that extends to the entire world -- further realized by releasing the sands into flowing
            water.</p>

    <h2>what is sand mandala?
        <p>Unique to Tibetan Buddhism, sand mandalas are believed to effect purification and healing. Typically, a great
            teacher chooses the mandala to be created, and monks consecrate the site with sacred chants and music. Next,
            they make a drawing and fill it in with colored sand.</p>
